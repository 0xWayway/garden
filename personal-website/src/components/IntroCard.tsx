            Hello, I'm Lucky
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Always a trader and a student. When I'm not in front of a screen, 
            you can usually find me on the climbing wall. I was involved in crypto 
            from 2021 to 2024 ‚Äî now I focus more on market dynamics and mechanisms.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A little bit of nomad, right now based in Xiamen and a new community 
            in Malaysia, hoping to leave more footprints around the world in the future.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I love bread, pizza, soft wind, sunset, and walking by the river üçÉ
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If you're also into market or climbing, <strong className="font-bold">let's catch up!</strong>
            <br />
            Or if you just want to chat ‚Äî you're very welcome :)
